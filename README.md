# Xss-Scanner

This project focuses on developing a XSS automated scanner but with 100 % accuracy as it will check if the alert pop is appeared on the browser or not.

There are few path changes you have to do:

Main.py file:
  change the file_path parameter to the location where the spider.txt file is located
  
multithreading_testing.py file:
  Change the path for the geckodriver.exe
  Change the path for the XSS payload file
